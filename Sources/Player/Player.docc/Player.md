Create engaging audio and video playback experiences.

## Overview

The Player framework provides a complete toolbox to add advanced audiovisual media capabilities to your app.

Play content easily with a ``Player`` and display its content in the standard AVKit user interface with ``SystemVideoView``, or build an entirely custom user interface starting from a simple ``VideoView``. Play any kind of content from any source by implementing your own ``PlayerItem``s and ``Asset``s, no matter where your content comes from or how it must be played. Track playback with your own ``PlayerItemTracker``, whether for analytics purposes or Quality of Service (QoS) data collection.

The Player framework fully integrates with SwiftUI, embracing its declarative and reactive nature and letting you quickly iterate on your design ideas.
