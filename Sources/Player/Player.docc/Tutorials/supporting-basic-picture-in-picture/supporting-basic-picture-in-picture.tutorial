            Integrate a basic Picture in Picture experience into your application.
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Instantiate the ``Player``.
                
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: supporting-basic-picture-in-picture-2-1.swift) {
                    @Image(source: supporting-basic-picture-in-picture-2-1, alt: "A screenshot of a basic player.")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Ask the ``VideoView`` to activate Picture in Picture.
                
                > Tip: You can also use the ``SystemVideoView``. If that's the case, you can ignore the next step.
                
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: supporting-basic-picture-in-picture-2-2.swift)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Ignore the safe area.
                
                > Important: In iOS and iPadOS, PiP playback starts automatically if your video is playing in full-screen mode and the user exits the app.
                
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: supporting-basic-picture-in-picture-2-3.swift)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Now you can try to exit your app.

            }
            
            @Step {
                Picture in Picture should start.
