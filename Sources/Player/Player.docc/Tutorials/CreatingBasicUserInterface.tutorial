        @ContentAndMedia {
            Create a basic play and pause user interface by following these steps:
        }

        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Start by creating a content view.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-1.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-1.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Import the player package.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-2.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-2.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Instantiate the player.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-3.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-3.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }

            @Step {
                Add the video view to display the player content.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-4.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-4.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }

            @Step {
                Add a button to play and pause the player.
                
                At this step you are able to play and pause the player.
                But the button has the wrong state.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-5.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-5.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Update the button to reflect the player state.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-6.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-play-pause-tutorial-6.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Section(title: "Backward and Forward Seek") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Now we can go further by managing the seek backward and the seek forward to navigate through the media stream.
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                We can start by adding an horizontal stack that will contain all the buttons.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-1.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-1.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Add a new button for the backward seek.
                
                At this step the button has no action.
                So let's use the player to add backward action.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-2.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-2.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Add the backward action.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-3.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-3.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                We can proceed in the same manner with the forward action.
                
                Great! We've added two buttons. 
                However, as you can see, by default, the backward and forward actions seek -10 and +10 seconds, respectively.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-4.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-4.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                To update this behavior, we can use the player configuration.
                Let's add a configuration with new intervals, -5 seconds for the backward action and +15 seconds for the forward action.
                
                Note that we don't use minus interval for the backward interval.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-5.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-5.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Don't forget to update your UI consequently.
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-6.swift) {
                    @Image(source: basic-ui-seek-tutorial-6.jpg, alt: "A screenshot from an iPhone")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
