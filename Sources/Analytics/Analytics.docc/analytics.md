Measure app usage according to SRG SSR requirements.

## Overview

The Analytics framework provides a toolbox to measure app usage according to SRG SSR requirements:

- Analytics for internal usage, gathered through the [Commanders Act](https://www.commandersact.com) platform.
- Analytics for [Mediapulse](https://www.mediapulse.ch), an organization charged with collecting media consumption data in Switzerland.

### Measure app usage

You can measure application usage in two ways:

- <doc:page-views>
- <doc:events>

> Note: Streaming measurements are automatically collected when playing content using the CoreBusiness framework. Just ensure that tracking has been properly setup first.
