/// View controllers whose usage must be measured should conform to the `PageViewTracking` protocol, which describes
/// the associated measurement data.
///
/// By default, if a view controller conforms to the `PageViewTracking` protocol, a page view event will automatically
/// be sent each time its `viewDidAppear(_:)` method is called. Page views are also sent when the application returns
/// from background automatically.
///
/// If you need to precisely control when page view events are emitted, however, you can implement the optional
/// `isTrackedAutomatically` property to return `false`, disabling both mechanisms described above. This is mostly
/// useful when page view information is not available at the time `viewDidAppear(_:)` is called, e.g. if this
/// information is retrieved from a web service request. Beware that in this case you are responsible of calling
/// `UIViewController.trackPageView()` when:
///
///   - The view is visible and you received the information you needed for the page view.
///   - The application returns from background and the information you need for the page view is readily available.
///
/// If you prefer you can also perform manual page view tracking using the corresponding methods available from
/// the `Analytics` singleton. You are in this case responsible of following the rules listed above in the same way.
///
/// If your application uses custom view controller containers, and if you want to use automatic tracking, be sure to
/// have them conform to the `ContainerPageViewTracking` protocol so that automatic page views are correctly propagated
/// through your application view controller hierarchy. If a view controller does not implement this protocol but
/// contains children, page view events will be propagated to all of them by default.
