# Stream packaging advice

This article discusses how streams should be packaged for optimal compatibility with Pillarbox player.

## Automatic media option selection

Pillarbox player supports automatic media option selection based on language and accessibility settings (e.g. unforced subtitles, CC, SDH and audio description), both for audible and legible renditions. This requires streams to satifsfy common requirements which are listed below.

### Audio renditions

For automatic selection to work with audio description be sure that the corresponding [renditions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216#section-4.3.4.1) have the `public.accessibility.describes-video` characteristic. All renditions should also have their `AUTOSELECT` attribute set to `YES` so that the player can consider them for automatic selection.

### Legible renditions

For automatic selection to work with legible renditions:

- Unforced `SUBTITLES` and `CLOSED-CAPTIONS` renditions must have their `AUTOSELECT` attribute set to `YES` so that the player can choose among them in _Automatic_ mode.
- Forced `SUBTITLES` renditions [must](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/hls-authoring-specification-for-apple-devices#Subtitles) have their `AUTOSELECT` attribute set to `YES`. Note that Pillarbox player follows [Apple recommendations](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/AudioVideo/RN-AVFoundation/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010717-CH1-DontLinkElementID_3) and never returns forced subtitles for selection.

### CC and SDH

Pillarbox player supports closed captions (CC) and Subtitles for the Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing (SDH):

- CC renditions are identified by the `CLOSED-CAPTIONS` type. They must also have their `AUTOSELECT` attribute set to `YES`.
- SDH renditions [must](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/hls-authoring-specification-for-apple-devices#Accessibility) have the `SUBTITLES` type and the `public.accessibility.transcribes-spoken-dialog` and `public.accessibility.describes-music-and-sound` characteristics. They must also have their `AUTOSELECT` attribute set to `YES`.

## Trick mode / Trick play

Pillarbox player supports [trick mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/hls-authoring-specification-for-apple-devices#Trick-Play) (aka trick play) which requires dedicated I-frame playlists to be delivered in video master playlists to provide for a [faster seeking experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick_mode).

The player still attempts to provide a good seek experience when I-frame playlists are not available. In this case seek requests are performed in sequence, avoiding pending request interruption and eliminating superfluous seeks (an approach called _smooth seeking_). Note that this experience is an order of magnitude slower than the one obtained with trick mode, though.
